so let me explain how it works
there are a number of columns
inside those columns are what are called "cards"
cards are essentially tasks
when a task is ready for you it will be placed into the "dev backlog" column
anything in that column is ready for you to work on
when you start a task you need to drag the task you are working on into the "development" column
this shows me the card/task that you are currently working on
does that make sense?
yeah correct
once you have completed a task
move it from the "development" column to the "internal testing" column
once the card is in internal testing column
we will review and test
If there are fixes to be made we will move it backn into the fixes column with notes
Please ignore cards in the design column
im just setting some things up at the moment
So dont start just yet
But read through all the cards
And see if they make sense
Please note
That currently there are iOs designs attached to the cards
I shall invite you to dropbox
here the android design files are
